# AI_Project
University Project for AI Class. This project regroups different algorithms for various scenarios.

* **Research Algorithm**
  - Compares 5 different algorithms: **BFS**, **Random Search**, **Beam Search**, **Greedy Search**, and **A***.
  - Simulates a server network in Europe with the goal of finding the fastest way to connect two servers.

* **MinMax Algorithm**
  - Implements the game **Quoridor**. Player 1 can play against an AI that uses the MinMax algorithm with **alpha-beta pruning**.
  - Offers different difficulty levels to the player based on the depth of the algorithm.

* **Constraint Satisfaction**
  - Creates a **Team Builder** for the game **Overwatch**.
  - Allows the player to create the best possible team around their personal favorite character and the selected map.
